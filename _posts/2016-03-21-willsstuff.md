My Markdown example
===================

To create paragraphs just make sure that there is some space in between lines...

Like so.

Bullets and lists
-----------------

Here is how to implement bullets and lists.

###Bullets###

* Bullets are so...
* Simple
* Really they are. If you want to have another paragraph in your bullets

	Just add a tab before the new paragraph.
	
* And the bullets will work fine.

###Ordered lists###

1. These are easy to implement too
2. Also, you can extend them to another line the same way as bullets.

	With a new line and a tab.

3. Told you it would work.

Links

Code Blocks
-----------

If you are nerdy like me you may need to use some 

	code blocks 
or 

`code spans`

For code blocks insert a tab before each line of code. For code spans surround the text with the `\ character.

Horizontal Rules
----------------

Just put '-' or '*' on a single line like this:

---------------------------

That will create your horizontal rule.
